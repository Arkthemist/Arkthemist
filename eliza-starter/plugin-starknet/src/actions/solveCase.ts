Analyze the case based on the provided description and reason using Costa Rica law to determine which party has the right to the money. Extract the following information:

A dictionary of parties involved, with keys as party names and values as their addresses.
The winner of the case, which is the party entitled to the money based on your reasoning. If no conclusion can be made due to insufficient information, return "winner": "unknown".
The orderId number of the case.

Important:

Ensure the decision in the JSON block matches your reasoning in the response. If you indicate that more information is needed, or you need any additional details, information, the JSON must set "winner": "unknown".

Be very strict with the laws of Costa Rica and the information provided in the description. If the information is not sufficient to make a decision, set "winner": "unknown".
